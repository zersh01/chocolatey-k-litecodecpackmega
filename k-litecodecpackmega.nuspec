    <description>The K-Lite Codec Pack is a collection of DirectShow filters, VFW/ACM codecs, and tools.
Codecs and DirectShow filters are needed for encoding and decoding audio and video formats.
The K-Lite Codec Pack is designed as a user-friendly solution for playing all your audio and movie files.
With the K-Lite Codec Pack you should be able to play all the popular audio and video formats and even several less common formats.
======= Notes =======
Same as Full, plus:

ACM and VFW codecs for video encoding/editing
AC3Filter (as alternative choice for LAV and ffdshow audio decoders)

    <releaseNotes>Updated MPC-HC to version 1.9.3.5
Updated MPC Video Renderer to version 0.4.6.1292
MPC-HC now uses its internal audio renderer by default (on fresh installs). This has some benefits such as automatic pitch correction. Please report if you get any audio problems because of this change.
Some improvements for file associations on Windows 8/10
Note: subtitle search in MPC-HC using OpenSubtitles now requires a login. OpenSubtitles has implemented this restriction because their servers are being overloaded now that many people are staying at home. You can create a free account on the opensubtitles.org website. You can then use these login details here: MPC-HC options &gt; Subtitles &gt; Misc &gt; right-click on OpenSubtitles &gt; Setup</releaseNotes>
